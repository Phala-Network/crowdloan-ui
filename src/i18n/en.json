  "q1": "What are Kusama Parachain Slot Auctions？",
  "a1-1": "The Kusama Network is composed of a relay chain and multiple parachains (parallel chains). A slot is the interface between a parachain and the relay chain. The number of slots is limited and they are allocated via KSM bidding auctions. ",
  "a1-2": "The auction follows a modified \"candle auction.\" The first 2 days are an Open Period, and the next 5 days are an Ending Period. The auction will end at a random time during the Ending Period. The highest bidder at that random time is the winner. We expect there will be 5 auctions scheduled with about 7 days between auctions.",
  "a1-3": "Similar Polkadot Slot Auctions will come in the future where projects will bids DOT for slots, but the bidding time, bidding period, and number of slots will be different from Kusama.",
  "q2": "Why is Khala bidding for a Slot?",
  "a2": "By having a slot, Khala will be able to share in the security and consensus of the Kusama network and will gain on-chain communication with other parachains.",
  "q3": "Why is Khala running a KSM Crowdloan?",
  "a3": "The Crowdloan is a way for Khala's community to provide the KSM required to win an auction, and is an important part of Khala's launch in Kusama. It means the project can avoid selling many PHA to raise KSM for slot leases. At the same time, it's an opportunity to efficiently distribute PHA to those in the community who support Khala, which is part of the planned fair distribution of tokens.",
  "q4": "Why should I participate in Khala's Crowdloan?",
  "a4": "The Crowdloan is a low-cost way to obtain K-PHA tokens (exchangeable for PHA). Each 1 KSM you Crowdloan will get you 100 K-PHA. Your KSM is locked for a fixed period of time and then is spendable again, so you don't need to spend any money to get K-PHA. ",
  "q5": "What is Khala Parachain Slot auction process?",
  "a5-1": "1. You need to prepare your KSM by unlocking it in advance. It takes 7 days for your unlock to take effect.",
  "a5-2": "2. Users can register and invite friends through an invitation link.",
  "a5-3": "3. We are not participating in the the first Kusama slot auction.",
  "a5-4": "4. Staring with the second Kusama slot open for bidding, the Khala Crowdloan will be created and users can contribute KSM for Khala.",
  "a5-5": "5. Khala wins a slot!",
  "a5-6": "6. Khala launches as a Kusama Parachain.",
  "q6": "When will Khala's crowdloan start?",
  "a6": "Khala will create the Crowdloan when the second slot is open for bidding, and that's the time you can start to contribute KSM for Khala. The end time of the Crowdloan will be determined by the result of the auctions. Your KSM will be locked during the auction, even though Khala has not yet won. It will be unlocked at the end of the auctions or at the end of the slot lease that Khala wins.",
  "q7": "Where can I participate in Khala crowd lending?",
  "a7-1": "1. You can participate directly on this page (on-chain).",
  "a7-2": "2. You can participate through participating exchanges (off-chain).",
  "a7-3": "3. You can participate directly through the polkadot.js UI (on-chain).",
  "a7-4": "4. You can participate through a third-party DApp (on-chain).",
  "q8": "Where do the KSM I contributed reside?",
  "a8": "Your KSM will be locked in the control module of the Kusama relay chain through a special transaction. It is not transferred to a Khala account. You can still see these funds in the account, and Khala will never have access to it.",
  "q9": "How long will my KSM be locked?",
  "a9": "In the Kusama Network, a parachain slot lease is up to 8 periods of 6 weeks each. Khala will go for the longest lease period of 48 weeks. When Khala's bid wins, your KSM will be locked for 48 weeks starting from Khala's win of the slot. If the Khala bid fails for all the slots being auctioned in this Crowdloan, your KSM will be unlocked and available as the Crowdloan ends.",
  "q10": "How many K-PHA can I get as rewards for participating in the Khala Crowdloan?",
  "a10": "If an auction is won, you will get 100 K-PHA as a reward for each KSM you contribute for Khala. A cap of up to 15 million K-PHA will be released on a first-come, first-served basis. If the bid fails, there will be no reward.",
  "q11": "What is the referral reward?",
  "a11-1": "Khala will grant users an additional 0.5% referral reward. Before starting the auction, you can register in advance and bond your referral relationship with your friends. Once your friends lock KSM for Khala, you and your friends can get referral rewards.",
  "a11-2": "Example: After user A invites user B to participate in the slot auction, both A and B will receive an additional 0.5% of the support reward that user B would have received alone.",
  "q12": "How do I receive rewards?",
  "a12": "Rewards will be automatically distributed to your locked KSM account. The first 34% of your rewards will be released immediately after Khala connects as a parachain, and the remaining 66% of the rewards will be released monthly over the next 11 months.",
  "q13": "Is there a maximum or minimum lock amount?",
  "a13": "The single minimum lock amount is 0.1 KSM, and the maximum cumulative locked amount is 150,000 KSM.",
  "q14": "Can I contribute multiple times?",
  "a14": "Yes",
  "q15": "What is the relationship between K-PHA and PHA?",
  "a15": "K-PHA (for Khala on Kusama) and PHA (for Phala on Polkadot) are the same token and will be exchangable 1:1 after the Phala cross-chain bridge goes online. Because they are deployed as native tokens in different blockchain networks, they have different names.",
  "q16": "Where can I track Crowdloan status?",
  "a16": "After the Crowdloan starts, you'll be able to see Khala's Crowdloan total, crowd lenders, total rewards, the current bidding situation, and other information, all on this page.",
